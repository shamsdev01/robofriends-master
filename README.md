# RoboFriends React App

This is a simple React app called "RoboFriends" that allows users to search and display robot profiles. The app fetches robot data from an external API and dynamically updates the UI based on user search queries.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search:** Users can search for robots by entering a name in the search bar. The app dynamically filters and displays matching robot profiles.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices.

- **External API Integration:** Robot data is fetched from the [RoboHash API](https://robohash.org/) to generate unique robot images for each profile.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/robofriends.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd robofriends
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your web browser (`http://localhost:3000` by default).
2. Enter a robot name in the search bar.
3. The app dynamically updates the displayed robot profiles based on the search query.

## Customization

- **API Key:** The app currently uses the RoboHash API without requiring an API key. If you anticipate heavy usage or want to customize the API calls, consider obtaining an API key from [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/) and updating the API calls in the code.

## Deployment

To deploy the app, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized and minified files. You can then deploy this directory to your preferred hosting platform.
